---- LEGO Spike Prime Useless Machine 🤖 ----
The Useless Machine is a fun and entertaining LEGO robot that does exactly what its name says — nothing! When you turn it on, it immediately turns itself off. Built with LEGO Spike Prime or Mindstorms 51515 hardware, this amusing little bot demonstrates simple motor control and switch mechanisms in the most dramatic way possible.

====================================

🧠 Purpose
This project is designed as a small, playful robotics exercise that:

Demonstrates basic sensor and motor control using the Spike Prime or Mindstorms 51515 hub.

Teaches event-based programming (detecting a switch press and reacting to it).

Provides a fun showcase project for beginners learning LEGO robotics or Python coding for EV3/Spike Prime.

====================================

⚙️ How It Works
The robot starts in the “off” position with a visible toggle switch or lever.

When you flip the switch to turn it on, the hub detects the change via a force sensor, touch sensor, or color sensor (depending on your build).

The robot’s motor activates an arm mechanism that slowly pokes out of a lid or panel.

The arm cheekily flips the switch back off — completing its only purpose!

This simple cycle of you turning it on, it turning itself off is surprisingly entertaining to watch.

====================================

🧩 Requirements
LEGO Spike Prime or Mindstorms Robot Inventor (51515) set

At least 1 medium angular motor

1 force sensor

LEGO elements to build the box, switch, and arm. (You will not have all the parts if you're using the Spike Prime Kit, as I used another set along with spike prime)

====================================

🧠 Educational Value
This project can be used to explore:

Basic mechanical linkages

Event-driven programming

Fun automation ideas that demonstrate robotics principles in a humorous way

====================================

🏗️ Customization Ideas
Add sound effects or display animations when the robot “wakes up.”

Use a servo arm that knocks the switch in a funny motion.

I've already added some effects, feel free to change it!

📄 License
This code is free to use, so don't be shy to tinker, remix and test it out!
